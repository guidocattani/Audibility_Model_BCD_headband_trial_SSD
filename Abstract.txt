Abstract
Objective 
We modelled the head-shadow-effect compensation and speech understanding outcomes in single-sided deafened (SSD) subjects fitted during headband trial with a bone conduction device (BCD). 
Design
In this retrospective study, the participantsâ€™ BCD settings were used for measurements on the skull simulator. The sensation levels of the Bone-Conduction and Air-Conduction sound paths were compared, modelling three spatial conditions with speech in quiet. Full head-shadow-effect compensation occurred when the difference between sensation levels was equivalent of greater than zero. We calculated the phoneme-score using the Speech Intelligibility Index for the three conditions in quiet and, additionally, for seven conditions with speech and noise from different directions. 
Study sample 
Data from eighty-five SSD adults fitted with a BCD during headband trial period. 
Results 
According to our model, most subjects did not reach a full head-shadow-effect compensation with the signal at the BCD-side and in front. The modelled  speech understanding in quiet did not improve with the transcutaneous BCD compared to the unaided condition. In noise, we found a slight improvement in some specific conditions and minimal worsening in others.
